# Forecasting-Pizza-Prices-using-Predictive-Analytics
This project aims to forecast pizza prices using multiple linear regression, decision tree and random forest models. The project focuses on developing accurate prediction models by analyzing various factors such as diameter, topping, size, company, extra cheese, extra mushrooms and extra sauce. The data is pre-processed and analyzed to identify patterns and features that can be used to predict pizza prices accurately. The performance of the models is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, training score and testing score. The results of the project will be helpful for the pizza industry to predict prices accurately and make informed business decisions.

# General Information
The food industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, with various companies competing to provide customers with the best quality products at an affordable price. The problem addressed in this project is the difficulty that pizza restaurant owners and managers face in determining the optimal price for their products due to the various factors that affect pizza prices. In addition to providing insights on the key factors that contribute to pizza prices, this project also aims to develop accurate predictive models for forecasting prices. By leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree and Multiple Regression, we can build models that take into account various criteria such as pizza diameter, topping, variants and size and accurately forecast prices.
